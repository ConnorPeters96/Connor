            <h1>Learning Environment and Activities</h1>
            <p>The Department of Computer Science is based in the state-of-the-art &pound; 13m Technology Hub. This purpose-built development offers highly contemporary suites of outstanding facilities for Computer Science students. Our modern computer laboratories are equipped with high-specification computers, high-resolution screens and the latest hardware and software. There is a four-screen CAVE (Computer Augmented Virtual Environment) provides a super immersive 3D virtual environment, enabling users to immerse themselves in a virtual room and experience real life scenarios in 4K resolution. There are also specialist laboratories for networking and games programming, in addition to a specialist research laboratory, open access laboratory, a Harvard style lecture theatre, and 'The Hatchery', a working space for new business ideas.</p>
            <p>Learning resources include a programmable child-sized robot, wired and wireless networking hardware, graphics software, web development tools, software development environments, big data servers, giant 3D interactive teaching screens, and other specialist software required for studying forensics and internet security techniques. The department has strong links with industry and the curriculum is kept current and highly relevant through input from our Employer Advisory Panel. A dedicated Enterprise Projects Team and Web Factory social enterprise initiative recruit students to paid work on a range of commercial projects. This provides you with the opportunity to gain experience in a commercial environment. You will also be actively supported in developing solutions for local businesses through your coursework.</p>
            <p>There are competitions including 'University Technology Challenge' and 'Hackathon', organised in collaboration with companies such as Barclays, the BBC and Talk Talk, allow you to show invention and initiative through, for example, inventing new apps and presenting a business case in a highly competitive environment. There is also an annual employability conference and specialist careers fair prepare you for employment. You can also engage with research through the 'INSPIRE' initiative, with some of our students having papers published at international conferences. </p>
